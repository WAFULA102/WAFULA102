I created my log about organic farming on WAFULA organic farm.
I used canva app and Adobe Photoshop to create the logo and editing it.
I used green color to represent the natur of crop and yellow to represent sun shine required by crops. 
I used the three images to demonstrate what is being done on the farm.
I got this images from Google and I used Adobe Photoshop to edit them.
